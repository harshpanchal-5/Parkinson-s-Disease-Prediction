# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction
This project predicts Parkinson's disease using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.  Built with Python and Scikit-learn, it analyzes voice measurements to classify patients with over 92% accuracy. The repository includes the dataset, the Jupyter Notebook with the complete workflow, and the final trained model (.sav) for direct use.
